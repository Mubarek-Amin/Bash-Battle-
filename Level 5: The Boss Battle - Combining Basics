Level 5: The Boss Battle - Combining Basics

Mission: Combine what you've learned! Write a script that:

1. Creates a directory names 'Battlefield'
2. Inside Battlefield, create files named knight.txt, sorcerer.txt, and rogue.txt.
3. Check if knight.txt exists; if it does, move it to a new directory called Archive.
4. List the contents of both Battlefield and Archive.

#!/bin/bash

mkdir -p Battlefield
touch Battlefield/knight.txt Battlefield/sorcerer.txt Battlefield/rogue.txt
if [ -f "Battlefield/knight.txt" ]
then
    mkdir -p Archive
    mv Battlefield/knight.txt Archive/
    echo "knight.txt has been moved to Archive"
else
    echo "knight.txt not found"
fi
echo "Contents of Battlefield:"
ls Battlefield
echo "Contents of Archive:"
ls Archive
